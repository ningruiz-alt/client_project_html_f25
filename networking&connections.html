        <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Networking allows you to learn from others' experiences, gain valuable insights into different roles and organizations, and uncover opportunities that may not be publicly advertised. Developing your connections is a skill that grows over time—and one that can give you a real advantage in today’s job market.
